## Machine learning Task 2 Submission.

Here is the CSV file which has the predicted CTC column.

# Task 2 ML Internship by Deep Malviya

## Problem Statement

Your task is to help John from STA IT services to create a linear regression model in Python or R to predict the CTC/Salary of new hires from the data provided. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn.


```python
#Make sure you have installed these packages.
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import sklearn
```
## Resources

I have uploaded train data file and Test data file make sure to add them correctly.

## Extra Implementation

I have also implemented Decision tree for better R2 Score. You may ignore that part.

Main model is Linear Regression (LR) and final output file is also generated with LR.
